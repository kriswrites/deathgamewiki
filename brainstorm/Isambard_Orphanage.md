# Isambard Orphanage & The Withered

#### Nicolas Bram
Nicolas Bram is a trouble child. Parents died when he was 9. He had no friends or close friendly to turn to. He spent months on the street before picked up by the cops. Nicolas was then adopted by Isambard Orphanage. Bram was forced to take a series of tests every day for over 6 months. The distribution was measured for the most accurate score possible of his abilities. Bram's mental faculties were unlike seen in anyone before him. He effortlessly maxed every measure.

Bram was quickly placed into a group known as "The Withered" who were worked to death for the success of the family behind Isambard Orphanage. Bram was given a number 333. He was the 333rd child to be taken in by Isambard Orphanage, and only the 28th Withered of 19 who are still alive.

Bram spends his time back and forth between analyzing stock market trends, and solving criminal cases that relate to a terrorist organization named "The Jihad Coalition," who follow the True Path religion which believes that killing is the way to enlightenment and that only those who are willing to kill deserve to live.

#### Isambard Orphanage
Isambard Orphanage was started in 1970 as a secret division of Remington & Co. to secretly exploit child labor behind the scenes. Due to national laws around orphanages limiting the number of kids any one orphanage could adopt, Isambard hired mercenaries to kidnap for them if it ever came to that. Isambard used a series of specially developed standard tests to divide the children into groups based on capabilities. They had no access to fun, the outside, and limited access to socialize during lunch. This caused serious mental illness among the children, which was handled by Malakai Othello, a former world-renowned psychiatrist known as Doc.

Isambard Orphanage was relocated to China in 2012 and was put in a much nicer facility in the outlands, designed by an architect named Sydney Lane.

#### The Withered
Fabian Morrison, once married to Robin Lane, is the father of Sydney Lane and her elder sister Rose-Marie Lane. Fabian is responsible for the tests known as "The Empyrean." The Empyrean was a test designed to comprehend the scope of the mental faculties of each individual, independent of where they come from and the knowledge they learned. The goal was to find a constant variable of their mental power that could not be changed through learning new information. He succeeded in this task. The students who scored above 140 on this test were placed in a specialized group, as their capabilities were so far apart from the rest. This group was known as The Withered.
