Enora Castro, famous among archaeologists and anthropologists, solved the Mystery of Bermuda Island—a small piece of land with a native population resurfacing in the Bermuda Triangle.

#### Shivani Baxter
Shivani Baxter is a globally recognized figure, especially in Indiana, and in Uttar Pradesh, the graphic "SB" is a symbol of horror and retribution for the wicked. Shivani first announced herself in the year ___. A voice recording sent to the police detailed an exact play-by-play for capturing the organization Murkt, a terrorist group known for kidnapping and arson. Initially, the police suspected a trick by Murkt, but the Chief of Police convinced the captain to follow Shivani’s instructions.  

Following Murkt’s capture, Shivani became a public symbol of fear. The NIA investigated using voice recognition and global databases but found no matches. In response to her "Baxter Documents" letters left for local police, the Head of the NIA called Shivani "Inhumanly Sagacious," suggesting her mental prowess was unparalleled.  

#### General Backstory
Rylee left her family at 16 but has access to a trust yielding an income of $450,000 annually, which she invests, living off dividends. Apathetic by nature, Rylee is interested only in her detective work. Life, to her, is a game, and she views intellectual challenges as tools for exploring her curiosity. Rylee has solved over 150 cases but chooses only those that interest her or offer a challenge.  

Rylee is Chaotic Neutral, motivated solely by self-interest. She has a high affinity for sweets due to low blood sugar, often carrying a bag of sugar cubes. Although a hermit, she possesses high emotional intelligence and understands people’s motives, though this rarely affects her behavior toward them. Her direct communication style is seen by some as interesting, while others find it disrespectful.  

Rylee rents a penthouse anonymously, using the social information of a former classmate. Her room has pitch-black walls patterned in a cube-like design, high-intensity blue lights, and a 35-inch monitor on the floor next to her futon.  

#### Moncler Family & Its Societal Relevance
The Moncler family, a societal staple, owns Moncler Pharmaceuticals, a pharmaceutical giant holding the IP rights to nearly every legal drug, with top-tier lawyers, scientists, and judges at their disposal. For nearly three centuries, Rylee’s lineage has been involved in the Court, unknown to her.  

#### Project M & The Foundations for "Chrona Milady"
For over 13 years, the Moncler family has worked on a disease named Project M for the Court, designed solely for population control. Rylee, uninterested in her family’s medical dealings, remains unaware of Project M, despite completing her M.D. at 15 due to an accelerated university track set by her family.  

#### Faustus & Ilya Moncler
Faustus and Ilya Moncler are the current heads of the Moncler fortune. Raised in Monaco, Faustus followed a strict routine from a young age to prepare for leading the Moncler Dynasty. He attended Universiteit de la Croix on a fast-track program and was expected to complete his Ph.D. by 17. However, his relationship with Ilya delayed his studies, angering his father, who threatened Ilya’s life if she interfered again.  

Shortly after the threat, Faustus’s father died in a fire, which the Court dismissed as an accident. As heir, Faustus transitioned into power, learning the family's values and systems. Under the Court’s strict order, Faustus would not learn of their existence until 21, when he would be initiated or, if he refused, executed.
