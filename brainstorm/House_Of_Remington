# House Of Remington 

#### Minerva Remington

Minerva and her younger brother Elmer are heirs to the ultra-wealthy Remington dynasty, with a family fortune valued at $162 billion. Her parents, Niccolo and Vienna Remington, have invested heavily in her future, sending her to prestigious boarding schools and spending $10 million annually on private tutors to groom her for a leadership role in Remington Media. Minerva is a natural leader with a high IQ of 132 and an ENTJ personality type. She is known for her academic excellence, top national debating skills, leadership of the swim team, and participation in equestrian sports and high-society events.

Minerva is passionate about social issues, dedicating 20% of her annual income—totaling $4 million—to philanthropy, and chairs the Remington Foundation. She has a decisive, action-oriented nature, often jumping into projects with a broad outline and refining them later. Known for her punctuality and intense focus, she holds fierce eye contact, viewing those who break it as weak.

Her intellectual and professional pursuits extend into genetic research, where she interns at Moncler Life Sciences. She assists in studying *Chrona Malady*, a neurodegenerative disease with a fatal onset at age 30. Minerva idolizes Sydney Lane, a polymath who passed away due to *Chrona Malady*, and has invested $350 million to acquire Lane’s research journals. Lane’s legacy serves as Minerva’s guiding star, and she often asks herself, *“What Would Sydney Do?”* in moments of uncertainty.

In addition to her scientific work, Minerva dabbles as a high-end art curator, private event planner, and celebrity stylist, following her passions rather than financial motivations. Her worldview is defined as Chaotic Good, willing to break rules to further the greater good.

#### Elmer Remington

Elmer, Minerva’s 14-year-old brother, is equally ambitious, though his values starkly differ. Known as “Young Master” by the household staff, Elmer is focused on enhancing the Remington family legacy and is preparing to one day take over the empire. He has skillfully invested through his firm, *Elmer & Rhinestone*, growing his wealth to over $1 billion. Despite this, he lives on a self-imposed budget of $1 million annually, using it strategically to gain influence in global black-market dealings.

In stark contrast to Minerva’s values, Elmer is motivated solely by power and wealth, viewing people as tools to be used. His two closest associates, Vincent and Dimitri, are more henchmen than friends. Operating with a Neutral Evil outlook, Elmer lacks moral qualms and aims to place the Remington family in a position of world leadership. Unbeknownst to him, his growing influence may attract the attention of the *Court of Kismet*, a secret organization that keeps the elite in check.

#### Valentino and Bessie Remington

Valentino and Bessie are the formidable heads of the Remington empire. Valentino, chairman of Remington Media, grew up under the absence of his father, developing a relentless drive to prove himself. Driven by the belief that love and success must be earned, Valentino mastered skills in sales, public speaking, and investing. When he took over the family business at age 23, he faced skepticism due to his youth, but one board member, Carlos Vincente, took him under his wing, mentoring him on the methods and mindset of the elite.

Valentino’s mentorship under Carlos instilled in him the ruthless mentality needed to expand and maintain power. When he uncovered Carlos’s plan to expose the *Court of Kismet*, Valentino, fearing retribution, reported him, leading to Carlos’s elimination by the Court.
